# Supported Platforms

It is tested on the below platforms but it works with both IL2CPP and Mono (including AOT platforms) backends:

- Standalone (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- Mobile (Android, iOS)
- WebGL
- UWP

By the way, it should work on all platforms that Unity supports, we're going to test it on other platforms too but those are the tested platforms so far.

If you face any issues on any platform, please contact us at support@bayat.io.
